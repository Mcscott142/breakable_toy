<h3>Swap Not Shop</h3>
<p>Swap it don't shop it. Swap ! Shop is a place for people to trade all of their stuff for new and different stuff! It's kind of like craigslist but less creepy. All you have to do is sign up and start adding listings. You can then entertain trade offers from other users or make offers yourself.</p>
